    <h1><mark>Eminem's early life</mark></h1>
    <p>"Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, had a difficult upbringing marked by poverty, instability, and emotional hardship; raised primarily by his single mother, Debbie Mathers, he spent much of his childhood moving between homes in Missouri and Michigan before settling in a rough Detroit neighborhood where he faced constant bullying and racial tensions as one of the few white kids in a predominantly Black community, all while dealing with a strained relationship with his mother and repeated academic failures that eventually led him to drop out of high school at the age of 17."

   <h1><mark>Eminem's rising career</mark></h1>
   <p>"Eminem’s rise to fame began in the gritty underground rap scene of Detroit, where his sharp lyrical skills, rapid-fire delivery, and raw storytelling set him apart during local freestyle battles, but it was the creation of his violent and provocative alter ego, Slim Shady, that truly helped him gain notoriety, especially after releasing the 'Slim Shady EP' in 1997—a project that showcased his unfiltered style and eventually caught the attention of legendary producer Dr. Dre, who was so impressed by Eminem's talent that he signed him to Aftermath Entertainment; this partnership led to the release of 'The Slim Shady LP' in 1999, which catapulted Eminem into international stardom, earning him massive commercial success, widespread media attention, and his first Grammy Award, solidifying him as one of the most controversial yet powerful new voices in hip-hop."
