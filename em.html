    <h1><mark>Eminem's early life</mark></h1>
    <p>"Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, had a difficult upbringing marked by poverty, instability, and emotional hardship; raised primarily by his single mother, Debbie Mathers, he spent much of his childhood moving between homes in Missouri and Michigan before settling in a rough Detroit neighborhood where he faced constant bullying and racial tensions as one of the few white kids in a predominantly Black community, all while dealing with a strained relationship with his mother and repeated academic failures that eventually led him to drop out of high school at the age of 17."
